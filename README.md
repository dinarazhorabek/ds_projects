## 📁 Projects Overview

### **1. Inertia Trading – Boeing (BA) & S&P 500 (SPY)**
Explores short-term trading strategies using:
- Rule-based intraday inertia signals  
- Weekly machine learning labeling (kNN, SVM, Random Forest, etc.)  
- K-means clustering and Hamming distance analysis across Dow Jones stocks  
Includes trading simulations, model comparisons, and visual insights.

### **2. Banknote Authentication – k-NN & Logistic Regression**
Using the UCI Banknote Authentication Dataset:
- Exploratory pairplots for real vs. fake notes  
- Simple rule-based classifier  
- Optimized **k-NN** model (k=3 → ~99.7% accuracy)  
- **Logistic Regression** with coefficient interpretation  
- Feature-importance analysis through exclusion tests  

Focuses on understanding classifier behavior and feature influence.
